      <p>As you can probably see, I have definitely advanced my skills exponentially since I made this rough website. I
        still include it in this portfolio because it meant so much to my team whenever we made it as freshman with absolutely no coding
        experience. I am still proud of this project because I knew so little whenever my team still pushed through and got
        something to compile. It is a huge testament to how quick I am able to pick up languages and how well I can work with
        others.</p>
